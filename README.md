Full Stack Home Rentals Application
Technologies Used: React JS, Redux, Node JS, Express, MongoDB, JWT, Material UI, RESTful APIs

Description: Developed a comprehensive Home Rentals platform, allowing users to browse, list, and manage rental properties in various categories. This application facilitates seamless interaction between tenants and landlords with features such as property listings, detailed listing pages, user authentication, and personalized property management.

Key Features:

User Authentication & Authorization: Implemented secure login/signup functionality using JWT for token-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access their listings and modify personal information.
Property Listings: Designed a dynamic, responsive interface to display properties in different categories (e.g., apartments, houses, etc.), utilizing Material UI for a sleek, user-friendly experience.
Property Details: Each property has a detailed view with photos, description, location, and rental details, allowing users to make informed decisions.
User Profiles & Listings: Users can create and manage their own listings, view their past listings, and modify property details, all protected with proper access control.
State Management with Redux: Utilized Redux for efficient state management across the front-end, ensuring smooth user experience with real-time data updates and enhanced performance.
Back-End API (Node JS, Express): Built a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for properties and user accounts, with full integration between the front-end and back-end.
Database (MongoDB): Utilized MongoDB for storing and retrieving property listings and user information, ensuring scalability and flexibility in handling dynamic data.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Key Achievements:

Delivered a full-stack solution that seamlessly integrates front-end and back-end technologies to manage and display rental properties.
Ensured robust and secure user authentication with JWT tokens, enhancing the appâ€™s security.
Designed an intuitive UI with Material UI, improving user experience and making property navigation simple and effective.
Managed state efficiently with Redux, ensuring real-time updates for users across multiple pages.
This project is a solid example of my ability to develop and deploy scalable full-stack applications, combining front-end and back-end skills to create a functional, secure, and engaging platform.
